# Dashboard Stat Cards Fix Verification

## Issue
The stat cards in the Dashboard page had overlapping text where the title (e.g., "Dagens avtaler") was overlapping with the icon in the card header.

## Root Cause
The flex container with `justify-between` was not properly constraining the title text, allowing it to expand and overlap with the icon. The title needed proper flex constraints to prevent overflow.

## Solution Applied
Modified the stat card header layout in `/home/ubuntu/barbertime/client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`:

### Changes Made (Line 110-116)
1. Reduced spacing from `space-y-4` to `space-y-3` for tighter layout
2. Reduced gap from `gap-3` to `gap-2` between title and icon
3. Added `flex-1 min-w-0` to the title (`<h3>`) to allow proper text wrapping and prevent overflow
4. Added `flex-none` to the icon container to prevent it from shrinking
5. Kept `shrink-0` on icon container to ensure icon always maintains its size

### CSS Classes Applied
- Title: `text-sm font-medium text-card-foreground leading-tight flex-1 min-w-0`
- Icon container: `p-2 rounded-lg bg-gradient-to-br ${stat.gradient} shadow-lg group-hover:scale-110 transition-transform shrink-0 flex-none`

## Verification Results
✅ Tested in browser at: https://3000-ih3of2pbfrb0woplorgjj-875f370d.manusvm.computer/dashboard
✅ All four stat cards display correctly:
   - "Dagens avtaler" - No overlap
   - "Ventende" - No overlap
   - "Dagens omsetning" - No overlap
   - "Totalt kunder" - No overlap

✅ Icons remain visible and properly positioned
✅ Text wraps appropriately when needed
✅ Layout is responsive and clean
