# BarberTime SaaS – Complete Technical Specification

## SECTION 1 – Vision & Core Purpose

### Why BarberTime Exists in the Norwegian Market

Norwegian barbershops, hair salons, and beauty salons face significant operational challenges that stem from outdated manual systems and fragmented digital tools. Many small salon owners rely on paper appointment books, spreadsheets, and disconnected payment solutions, leading to missed appointments, revenue leakage, and administrative overhead that consumes time better spent with customers.

Existing booking platforms in the Norwegian market often fall into two problematic categories: **generic international solutions** that lack Norwegian payment integration (Vipps), proper VAT handling, and Norwegian language support; or **overly complex enterprise systems** designed for large chains that overwhelm single-location salons with unnecessary features and steep learning curves.

### Pain Points with Current Systems

**Manual appointment management** creates scheduling conflicts, double-bookings, and no-show losses that directly impact revenue. Without automated reminders, salons experience 15-20% no-show rates, representing substantial lost income.

**Fragmented payment handling** forces salon staff to juggle multiple systems: cash registers, card terminals, Vipps transfers, and manual reconciliation. This complexity increases errors in accounting, complicates VAT reporting, and creates audit risks.

**Lack of business intelligence** means salon owners make decisions based on gut feeling rather than data. They cannot easily answer fundamental questions: Which services generate the most profit? Which employees drive the most revenue? What are the busiest hours? When should they hire additional staff?

**Compliance burden** around GDPR, customer data retention, and Norwegian accounting standards (SAF-T) creates anxiety for non-technical salon owners who fear regulatory penalties but lack the expertise to ensure compliance.

### Core Value Proposition vs Generic Booking Apps

BarberTime differentiates itself through **Norwegian-first design**. Every feature is built specifically for the Norwegian market: native Vipps integration, Norwegian VAT handling (25% standard rate with proper codes), SAF-T-compatible export formats, and Norwegian language throughout the interface.

**Vertical integration** means BarberTime is not just a booking tool—it combines appointment management, customer relationship management, inventory tracking, point-of-sale functionality, accounting integration, and business intelligence into a single coherent system. This eliminates the need for salon owners to stitch together multiple subscriptions and manually transfer data between systems.

**Simplicity without sacrifice** is the design philosophy. BarberTime provides enterprise-grade functionality (multi-location support, role-based access control, comprehensive reporting) while maintaining an interface so intuitive that a salon owner can onboard their team in under an hour without technical training.

**Fair pricing** aligns with the economics of small Norwegian salons. Unlike enterprise systems that charge per-location or per-feature, BarberTime offers transparent tier-based pricing that scales with the salon's size, making professional tools accessible to single-chair barbershops and multi-location chains alike.

### Why "Enkelt og Ryddig" UX is Central

Norwegian salon owners are **craftspeople, not IT professionals**. They excel at cutting hair, applying treatments, and building customer relationships—not navigating complex software interfaces. The "enkelt og ryddig" (simple and tidy) design principle acknowledges this reality.

**Cognitive load reduction** means every screen presents only the information needed for the current task. The appointment calendar shows today's bookings prominently, with tomorrow and next week accessible through clear navigation—not buried in date pickers. The checkout process requires three taps: select service, select payment method, confirm.

**Predictable patterns** ensure that once a user learns one part of the system, they can intuitively navigate others. All list views (customers, products, services, employees) follow the same layout. All forms use consistent validation and error messaging. All actions (edit, delete, archive) appear in the same locations.

**Forgiveness** is built into the system. Accidental deletions can be undone. Draft appointments can be saved and completed later. The system auto-saves form inputs so that interruptions (a customer walking in, a phone call) don't result in lost work.

**Performance** is a UX feature. BarberTime loads in under two seconds on Norwegian mobile networks. Actions provide immediate feedback—when a user books an appointment, the calendar updates instantly without waiting for server confirmation. Background synchronization ensures data consistency without blocking the user.

This focus on simplicity is not about dumbing down the software—it's about **respecting the user's time and expertise**. Salon owners should spend their cognitive energy on their craft, not on learning software.

## SECTION 2 – Functional Requirements (Ultra-Detailed)

### 2.1 Booking Engine

The booking engine is the core of BarberTime, responsible for managing appointment scheduling, conflict detection, and customer notifications. It must handle the complexity of multiple employees with varying schedules, services with different durations, and customer preferences while presenting a simple interface.

**Time-slot generation** operates on a per-employee, per-service, per-day basis. Each employee has a weekly schedule template defining their working hours (e.g., Monday 09:00-17:00, Tuesday 10:00-18:00). The system generates available time slots by:

1. Loading the employee's schedule for the requested date
2. Retrieving all existing appointments for that employee on that date
3. Calculating the service duration (e.g., "Herreklipp" = 30 minutes, "Farge + klipp" = 90 minutes)
4. Generating slots at 15-minute intervals (configurable per salon)
5. Filtering out slots that would overlap with existing appointments or fall outside working hours
6. Applying buffer time between appointments (configurable, default 5 minutes for cleanup)

**Parallel booking handling** must prevent race conditions when multiple customers book simultaneously. The system uses optimistic locking with version timestamps:

1. When a customer selects a time slot, the frontend displays a "Hold this slot" countdown (default 5 minutes)
2. The backend creates a temporary reservation with status `PENDING` and expiration timestamp
3. If the customer completes booking before expiration, status changes to `CONFIRMED`
4. If expiration passes, a background job releases the slot and notifies the customer (if contact info was captured)
5. Concurrent booking attempts for the same slot receive immediate feedback: "This slot was just booked. Please select another time."

**24-hour Norwegian time format** is enforced throughout the system (09:00, 14:30, 17:00) with no AM/PM notation. All times are stored in UTC in the database but displayed in Norwegian timezone (CET/CEST with automatic daylight saving adjustment).

**Rescheduling rules** allow customers and staff to modify appointments with appropriate constraints:

- Customers can reschedule up to 24 hours before the appointment (configurable per salon)
- Staff can reschedule at any time
- Each reschedule operation creates an audit log entry recording: original time, new time, who made the change, timestamp, reason (optional text field)
- If rescheduling would create a conflict, the system suggests the next three available slots for that employee/service combination

**Cancellation policies** are configurable per salon with three tiers:

1. **Free cancellation period** (e.g., 24 hours before): No charge, slot released immediately
2. **Late cancellation period** (e.g., 12-24 hours before): Optional cancellation fee (e.g., 50% of service price)
3. **No-show** (customer doesn't appear and doesn't cancel): Full service price charged (if payment method on file) or flagged in customer record

**No-show handling** includes:

- Automatic status change to `NO_SHOW` if appointment time passes without check-in
- Notification to salon staff
- Customer record updated with no-show count
- Optional automatic SMS to customer: "Vi savnet deg i dag. Vennligst gi beskjed neste gang." (We missed you today. Please let us know next time.)
- Configurable policy: After X no-shows, require prepayment for future bookings

**SMS and email reminders** operate via cron jobs:

- **24 hours before**: "Påminnelse: Du har time hos [Salon] i morgen kl [Time]. Bekreft eller avbestill: [Link]"
- **2 hours before**: "Din time hos [Salon] starter om 2 timer (kl [Time]). Vi gleder oss til å se deg!"
- Reminders are queued in a `notifications` table with retry logic (exponential backoff, max 3 attempts)
- Failed notifications are logged with reason (invalid phone number, email bounce, provider error)

**Recurrent bookings** support customers who book the same service at regular intervals (e.g., "Herreklipp every 4 weeks on Thursdays at 15:00"):

- Customer or staff creates a recurrence rule: frequency (weekly, biweekly, monthly), preferred day/time, end condition (after N occurrences or by date)
- System generates appointments in advance (default: next 3 months)
- Each appointment is independent—canceling one doesn't affect others
- System sends notification when the recurrence is nearing its end: "Din faste time utløper snart. Vil du fornye?"

**Group bookings** allow multiple customers to book related appointments (e.g., bridal party, family):

- One customer creates a group booking request specifying: number of people, services needed, preferred date/time range
- System suggests time slots where multiple employees are available simultaneously or in sequence
- Each person in the group gets an individual appointment record linked to the group booking ID
- Canceling the group booking cancels all related appointments with a single action

### 2.2 Customer Management (CRM-lite)

The customer management module stores and organizes customer information, visit history, preferences, and notes, enabling personalized service while maintaining GDPR compliance.

**Customer entity design** includes:

- **Identity fields**: First name, last name, phone number (Norwegian format: +47 XXX XX XXX), email address
- **PII fields**: Date of birth (optional, for birthday promotions), address (optional, for marketing segmentation)
- **Preferences**: Preferred employee, preferred services, preferred time slots (e.g., "always Thursdays after 16:00")
- **Notes**: Free-text field for allergies, sensitivities, style preferences (e.g., "allergisk mot ammoniakk", "liker kort på sidene")
- **Marketing consent**: Boolean flags for SMS marketing, email marketing, with consent timestamp and IP address (GDPR requirement)
- **Metadata**: Customer since date, total visits, total revenue, last visit date, average visit frequency

**GDPR considerations**:

- **Lawful basis**: Customer data is processed under "contract" basis (necessary for providing the service) and "consent" basis (for marketing)
- **Data minimization**: Only collect data necessary for service delivery
- **Purpose limitation**: Data collected for bookings cannot be used for marketing without explicit consent
- **Storage limitation**: Implement configurable retention period (default: 3 years after last visit)
- **Right to access**: Customers can request a data export (JSON format) via self-service portal or by contacting salon
- **Right to erasure**: Customers can request deletion; system implements soft delete with anonymization (replace name with "Deleted User", clear PII fields, retain visit history for accounting purposes)
- **Data portability**: Export format includes all customer data in machine-readable JSON
- **Consent management**: Customers can withdraw marketing consent at any time; system must honor immediately

**Visit history structure** stores:

- Appointment date/time
- Service(s) provided
- Employee who performed service
- Products used (for inventory tracking)
- Payment amount and method
- Customer satisfaction rating (optional post-visit survey)
- Notes from that visit (e.g., "brukte 20 vol utvikler", "klippet 3 cm")

**Data retention policies**:

- **Active customers** (visited within retention period): Full data retained
- **Inactive customers** (no visit within retention period): Automated email notification 30 days before deletion: "Vi har ikke sett deg på lenge. Dine data vil bli slettet om 30 dager med mindre du bestiller en time."
- **Deleted customers**: PII anonymized, visit history retained with anonymized customer ID for accounting/reporting requirements (Norwegian accounting law requires 5-year retention of transaction records)

**Right-to-be-forgotten flow**:

1. Customer submits deletion request via self-service portal or email to salon
2. System validates identity (email verification or phone verification)
3. System checks for upcoming appointments—if any exist, customer must cancel them first
4. System performs soft delete: sets `deleted_at` timestamp, anonymizes PII fields, removes from marketing lists
5. System sends confirmation email: "Dine data er slettet. Vi beholder anonymiserte transaksjonsdata for regnskapsformål."
6. After 90-day grace period (in case of accidental deletion), hard delete removes all remaining PII

### 2.3 Employees Module

The employees module manages salon staff, their schedules, roles, permissions, and commission calculations. It must handle the full employee lifecycle from onboarding to offboarding while preserving historical data integrity.

**Roles and permissions**:

- **Owner**: Full access to all features, can manage billing, can add/remove admins
- **Admin**: Can manage employees, services, products, view all reports, cannot access billing
- **Employee**: Can view their own schedule, check in customers, process payments, view their own performance reports, cannot access other employees' data or salon-wide settings

**Soft delete with isActive flag**:

When an employee leaves the salon, hard deletion would break historical data (past appointments, sales records, commission calculations). Instead, the system implements soft delete:

- Set `isActive = false` and record `deactivatedAt` timestamp
- Employee immediately disappears from:
  - Online booking interface (customers cannot select them)
  - Staff selection dropdowns in appointment creation
  - Staff assignment lists
- Employee data remains visible in:
  - Historical appointment records
  - Sales reports (with "(inaktiv)" suffix on name)
  - Commission calculations for past periods
  - Audit logs

**Re-assignment of future bookings** on deactivation:

1. System identifies all future appointments assigned to the deactivated employee
2. Admin is prompted: "Denne ansatte har X fremtidige timer. Hva vil du gjøre?"
3. Options:
   - **Reassign to another employee**: System checks availability and reassigns, sends notification to customer: "Din time er flyttet til [New Employee] på grunn av endringer i vår bemanning."
   - **Cancel appointments**: System cancels all future appointments, sends notification to customers with rebooking link
   - **Leave unassigned**: Appointments remain in system with "Ansatt ikke lenger tilgjengelig" status, admin must manually handle each

**Weekly schedule templates**:

Each employee has a default weekly schedule:

```
Monday: 09:00-17:00 (lunch break 12:00-12:30)
Tuesday: 09:00-17:00
Wednesday: Off
Thursday: 10:00-18:00
Friday: 09:00-17:00
Saturday: 09:00-15:00
Sunday: Off
```

**Vacation and absence tracking**:

- Employee or admin creates absence record: start date, end date, type (vacation, sick leave, training)
- System automatically blocks booking slots during absence period
- Existing appointments during absence are flagged for reassignment
- Absence records are visible in employee's calendar with color coding

**Commission calculation logic**:

Many Norwegian salons pay employees a base salary plus commission on services and product sales. BarberTime supports flexible commission structures:

- **Percentage of service revenue**: Employee receives X% of service price (e.g., 40% of "Herreklipp" price)
- **Percentage of product sales**: Employee receives Y% of product price when they sell retail products
- **Tiered commissions**: Commission percentage increases with monthly revenue (e.g., 30% for first 20,000 NOK, 35% above that)
- **Fixed per-service**: Employee receives fixed amount per service regardless of price (e.g., 100 NOK per haircut)

Commission calculation runs at month-end:

1. System aggregates all completed appointments and sales for each employee
2. Applies commission rules based on employee's contract settings
3. Generates commission report: total revenue, commission amount, breakdown by service/product
4. Report is available for employee to view and for owner to use in payroll processing

### 2.4 Payments

The payment module handles all financial transactions, integrating with payment providers while maintaining PCI compliance and providing robust error handling.

**Stripe integration for card payments**:

BarberTime uses Stripe Checkout for card payments in NOK:

1. Customer selects services and products
2. System calculates total including VAT (25% standard rate for most services, 15% for certain treatments)
3. System creates Stripe Checkout session with:
   - Amount in NOK (øre, smallest currency unit: 1 NOK = 100 øre)
   - Line items (services and products)
   - Customer email (pre-filled if available)
   - Success URL (redirects to confirmation page)
   - Cancel URL (returns to booking page)
4. Customer completes payment on Stripe-hosted page
5. Stripe sends webhook to `/api/payments/stripe/webhook` with payment status
6. System verifies webhook signature, updates appointment status to `PAID`, sends confirmation email

**Webhook handling**:

- `checkout.session.completed`: Payment successful, mark appointment as paid
- `checkout.session.expired`: Payment abandoned, send reminder email to customer
- `charge.refunded`: Refund processed, update appointment payment status, adjust accounting records

**Payment abstraction layer**:

To support future payment providers (especially Vipps), BarberTime implements an abstraction layer:

```typescript
interface PaymentProvider {
  createPayment(amount: number, currency: string, metadata: object): Promise<PaymentSession>;
  refundPayment(paymentId: string, amount?: number): Promise<RefundResult>;
  getPaymentStatus(paymentId: string): Promise<PaymentStatus>;
}

class StripeProvider implements PaymentProvider { /* ... */ }
class VippsProvider implements PaymentProvider { /* placeholder for future */ }
```

This allows adding Vipps integration without changing application logic—just implement the interface and configure the provider.

**In-salon manual payments**:

For customers who pay in person with cash or card terminal:

1. Staff selects appointment in calendar
2. Clicks "Merk som betalt"
3. Selects payment method: Cash, Card (terminal), Vipps (manual)
4. Enters amount (pre-filled with service total, editable for tips)
5. System records payment with timestamp, method, amount, staff member who processed it

**Refunds and accounting impact**:

- **Full refund**: Reverses entire payment, updates appointment status to `REFUNDED`, creates accounting entry to offset original revenue
- **Partial refund**: Refunds portion of payment (e.g., customer unhappy with one service in a multi-service appointment), creates accounting entry for refund amount
- All refunds require reason (dropdown: "Kundens forespørsel", "Servicefeil", "Avbestilling", "Annet") and optional notes
- Refunds are reported separately in accounting exports to maintain audit trail

**Error handling**:

- **Failed payments**: Customer sees user-friendly error message, system logs technical details (Stripe error code, message), staff receives notification to follow up
- **Timeouts**: If payment provider doesn't respond within 30 seconds, system shows "Behandler betaling..." message and polls status every 5 seconds for up to 2 minutes
- **Webhook failures**: If webhook processing fails, system retries with exponential backoff (1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 1 hour), sends alert to owner after 3 failures

**PCI considerations**:

BarberTime never handles raw card data—all card information flows directly to Stripe. The system only stores:

- Stripe payment intent ID
- Last 4 digits of card (provided by Stripe)
- Card brand (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)
- Payment status

This ensures PCI compliance without requiring expensive security audits.

### 2.5 Store Products & Direktsalg

The inventory and direct sales module manages product catalog, stock levels, and point-of-sale transactions for retail products sold in the salon.

**Product catalog structure**:

- **SKU**: Unique product identifier (e.g., "SHP-001")
- **Name**: Product name (e.g., "Redken Brews Shampoo 300ml")
- **Category**: Grouping (Shampoo, Conditioner, Styling, Color, Tools)
- **Cost price**: What the salon pays the supplier (for profit calculation)
- **Retail price**: What customers pay
- **VAT code**: Norwegian VAT rate (25% for most products, 15% for certain items)
- **Barcode**: EAN/UPC for barcode scanner integration
- **Supplier**: Supplier name and contact info
- **Stock level**: Current quantity on hand
- **Reorder point**: Threshold that triggers low-stock alert
- **Reorder quantity**: Suggested order quantity when restocking

**Inventory decrement rules**:

Stock levels decrease in two scenarios:

1. **Direct sales**: Customer purchases product at checkout, stock decrements by quantity sold
2. **Service consumption**: Certain services use products (e.g., hair coloring uses color tubes, developer, toner), stock decrements based on service-product associations

**Service-product associations**:

Services can have linked products with usage quantities:

```
Service: "Hårfarge - heldekkende"
Products used:
- Color tube (60ml): 1 unit
- Developer (120ml): 1 unit
- Toner (20ml): 0.5 unit
```

When this service is performed, stock automatically decrements by these amounts.

**Bundles**:

Salons can create bundles (service + product) at discounted prices:

```
Bundle: "Klipp + Styling Pakke"
- Service: Herreklipp (300 NOK)
- Product: Styling Wax (150 NOK)
Bundle price: 400 NOK (50 NOK discount)
```

Bundles are treated as single line items at checkout but broken down into components for inventory and accounting purposes.

**Stock alerts**:

When product stock falls below reorder point:

- System sends notification to owner/admin: "Lav beholdning: [Product Name] har kun [X] igjen. Bestill mer?"
- Product is highlighted in inventory list with warning icon
- System can optionally generate purchase order draft with supplier info and reorder quantity

**Stock adjustments**:

Manual stock adjustments (for receiving shipments, correcting errors, handling damaged goods):

1. Admin navigates to product in inventory
2. Clicks "Juster beholdning"
3. Enters new quantity and reason (dropdown: "Mottatt levering", "Telling", "Skadet vare", "Annet")
4. System creates audit log entry with old quantity, new quantity, adjustment amount, reason, timestamp, user

### 2.6 Regnskap & Reports

The accounting and reporting module provides financial visibility and generates exports compatible with Norwegian accounting standards.

**Sales reports**:

- **Daily sales report**: Total revenue, breakdown by payment method (cash, card, Vipps), number of transactions, average transaction value
- **Weekly sales report**: Revenue trend over 7 days, comparison to previous week, top services, top employees
- **Monthly sales report**: Total revenue, expenses (if tracked), net profit, VAT collected, breakdown by service category, breakdown by employee

**Per-employee reporting**:

- Revenue generated by each employee
- Number of services performed
- Average service value
- Commission earned (if applicable)
- Customer satisfaction ratings

**Per-service reporting**:

- Number of times each service was performed
- Total revenue per service
- Average price per service (accounts for discounts)
- Profitability (revenue minus product costs for services that consume products)

**Per-product reporting**:

- Units sold
- Revenue generated
- Profit margin (retail price minus cost price)
- Inventory turnover rate

**Cash register close-of-day process (kasseoppgjør)**:

At end of business day, staff performs cash register reconciliation:

1. System calculates expected cash: opening balance + cash payments - cash refunds
2. Staff counts physical cash and enters amount
3. System compares expected vs actual:
   - Match: "Kassen stemmer!" (register balanced)
   - Discrepancy: "Avvik: [X] NOK. Forventet [Y], faktisk [Z]" (discrepancy detected)
4. Staff enters explanation for discrepancy (if any)
5. System generates close-of-day report: total sales, payment method breakdown, discrepancies, staff member who closed
6. Report is locked (cannot be edited) and stored for audit purposes

**Export formats**:

- **CSV export**: Customizable columns, UTF-8 with BOM encoding (for Excel compatibility), date range filter, entity filter (all employees, specific employee, all services, specific service)
- **SAF-T friendly format**: Norwegian Standard Audit File for Tax (SAF-T) is the required format for tax audits. BarberTime exports include all required fields:
  - Transaction date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Transaction type (sale, refund, adjustment)
  - Amount excluding VAT
  - VAT code and amount
  - Payment method
  - Customer reference (if available)
  - Description

**Required fields for Norwegian accountants**:

Norwegian accountants need specific data points for VAT reporting and annual accounts:

- **Date**: Transaction date in ISO format
- **Type**: Income (inntekt), expense (utgift), adjustment (justering)
- **VAT code**: Norwegian VAT codes (3 = 25%, 33 = 15%, 5 = 0%, 6 = exempt)
- **Amount excluding VAT**: Net amount
- **VAT amount**: Calculated VAT
- **Total amount**: Gross amount (net + VAT)
- **Payment method**: Cash (kontant), card (kort), Vipps, invoice (faktura)
- **Account code**: Norwegian standard account codes (e.g., 3000-series for sales revenue)

### 2.7 Notifications

The notification module handles all customer and staff communications via SMS and email, with robust retry logic and rate limiting.

**SMS provider integration**:

BarberTime uses a generic SMS gateway interface that can connect to Norwegian providers (Twilio, Link Mobility, Intelecom):

```typescript
interface SMSProvider {
  sendSMS(to: string, message: string, sender: string): Promise<SMSResult>;
  getDeliveryStatus(messageId: string): Promise<DeliveryStatus>;
}
```

Configuration per tenant:

- Provider selection (dropdown)
- API credentials (encrypted at rest)
- Sender name (max 11 characters, alphanumeric, e.g., "BarberTime" or salon name)
- SMS quota per month (based on subscription plan)

**Email provider integration**:

Similar abstraction for email providers (Resend, SendGrid, Postmark):

```typescript
interface EmailProvider {
  sendEmail(to: string, subject: string, body: string, from: string): Promise<EmailResult>;
  sendTemplateEmail(to: string, templateId: string, variables: object): Promise<EmailResult>;
}
```

**Retry logic**:

Notifications can fail due to temporary issues (provider downtime, network errors). BarberTime implements exponential backoff:

1. Initial send attempt
2. If failure, wait 1 minute, retry
3. If failure, wait 5 minutes, retry
4. If failure, wait 15 minutes, retry
5. If failure, wait 1 hour, retry
6. If still failing after 5 attempts, mark as failed and alert salon owner

**Failed-notification log**:

All notification attempts are logged:

- Notification ID
- Type (SMS, email)
- Recipient
- Content
- Status (pending, sent, delivered, failed)
- Attempt count
- Last attempt timestamp
- Error message (if failed)

Salon staff can view failed notifications and manually retry or contact customer through alternative channel.

**Rate limiting per tenant**:

To prevent abuse and control costs:

- Each subscription plan includes SMS quota (e.g., Start plan: 100 SMS/month, Pro plan: 500 SMS/month)
- System tracks SMS usage per tenant per month
- When approaching limit (90%), owner receives warning notification
- When limit is reached, system stops sending SMS and notifies owner: "SMS-kvoten din er brukt opp. Oppgrader abonnementet eller vent til neste måned."
- Email has higher/unlimited quota since it's cheaper

### 2.8 Multi-Tenant SaaS

BarberTime is a multi-tenant SaaS platform where each salon is a separate tenant with isolated data and customizable settings.

**Tenant model**:

Each salon is represented by a tenant entity:

- **Tenant ID**: Unique identifier (UUID)
- **Salon name**: Display name (e.g., "Barber & Co Oslo")
- **Subdomain**: Custom subdomain for online booking (e.g., `barberco.barbertime.no`)
- **Contact info**: Phone, email, address
- **Business registration**: Norwegian organization number (organisasjonsnummer)
- **Branding**: Logo URL, primary color, accent color
- **Status**: Active, suspended (non-payment), trial, canceled

**Tenant isolation patterns**:

BarberTime uses **row-based isolation** with `tenantId` foreign key on all data tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE appointments (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
  customer_id INT NOT NULL,
  employee_id INT NOT NULL,
  -- other columns
  FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id) REFERENCES tenants(id),
  INDEX idx_tenant_appointments (tenant_id, appointment_date)
);
```

All queries include `WHERE tenant_id = ?` filter to ensure data isolation. This is enforced at the database access layer—application code cannot accidentally query across tenants.

**Default settings per tenant**:

Each tenant has customizable settings:

- **Timezone**: Norway uses CET/CEST, but system supports other timezones for international expansion
- **VAT rate**: Default 25%, but configurable for special cases
- **Currency**: NOK by default
- **SMS sender name**: Salon name or custom sender
- **Booking rules**: Advance booking limit (e.g., customers can book up to 60 days in advance), cancellation policy (24h, 12h, no cancellation), buffer time between appointments
- **Business hours**: Default opening hours for time slot generation
- **Language**: Norwegian (bokmål) by default, with support for nynorsk and English

**Subscription plan enforcement**:

Each tenant is assigned a subscription plan (Start, Pro, Premium) that determines feature access and limits:

- **User limits**: Start (1 employee), Pro (up to 5 employees), Premium (unlimited)
- **Branch limits**: Start (1 location), Pro (1 location), Premium (multiple locations)
- **SMS quota**: Start (100/month), Pro (500/month), Premium (2000/month)
- **Feature flags**: Start (basic booking + payments), Pro (+ inventory + reports), Premium (+ API access + advanced analytics)

System enforces limits:

- When adding employee, check if tenant has reached user limit: "Du har nådd grensen for antall ansatte i din plan. Oppgrader for å legge til flere."
- When sending SMS, check if tenant has remaining quota
- When accessing premium features, check if tenant's plan includes that feature

## SECTION 3 – Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Security & Privacy

**GDPR compliance**:

BarberTime processes personal data of salon customers and must comply with EU GDPR (which Norway implements through national law):

- **Lawful basis**: Contract (for service delivery) and consent (for marketing)
- **Data processing agreements**: Salons are data controllers, BarberTime is data processor. Standard DPA is provided to all customers
- **Data minimization**: Only collect necessary data
- **Purpose limitation**: Data collected for one purpose (booking) cannot be used for another (marketing) without consent
- **Storage limitation**: Configurable retention periods, automated deletion
- **Data subject rights**: Access, rectification, erasure, portability, restriction, objection
- **Privacy by design**: GDPR considerations built into every feature from the start

**Encryption**:

- **At rest**: Sensitive database columns (customer PII, payment info, API credentials) are encrypted using AES-256
- **In transit**: All connections use HTTPS/TLS 1.3, no unencrypted HTTP traffic allowed

**Role-based access control (RBAC)**:

- Owner: Full access
- Admin: Cannot access billing or delete tenant
- Employee: Can only view own schedule and process own appointments

Permissions are checked at API level—frontend restrictions are UX convenience, not security boundary.

**Audit logs**:

Critical operations are logged:

- Customer data deletion
- Employee deactivation
- Appointment cancellation
- Payment refund
- Settings changes

Logs include: timestamp, user who performed action, action type, affected entity, before/after values (for updates).

**Rate limiting and brute-force protection**:

- Login attempts: Max 5 failed attempts per IP per 15 minutes, then CAPTCHA required
- API endpoints: Max 100 requests per minute per tenant
- Password requirements: Min 8 characters, must include uppercase, lowercase, number

### 3.2 Reliability

**Transactions for critical operations**:

All operations that modify multiple tables use database transactions to ensure atomicity:

- Creating appointment (insert appointment, decrement inventory if service uses products, create notification records)
- Processing payment (update appointment status, create payment record, create accounting entry)
- Refunding payment (update payment record, create refund record, create accounting adjustment)

If any step fails, entire transaction rolls back—no partial state.

**Background jobs and queues**:

Long-running tasks are processed asynchronously:

- Sending notifications (SMS, email)
- Generating reports
- Processing exports
- Cleaning up expired reservations

BarberTime uses a job queue (implemented with database table + worker process):

```sql
CREATE TABLE jobs (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  type VARCHAR(50), -- 'send_sms', 'send_email', 'generate_report'
  payload JSON,
  status ENUM('pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed'),
  attempts INT DEFAULT 0,
  max_attempts INT DEFAULT 3,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  scheduled_at TIMESTAMP,
  processed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

Worker process polls for pending jobs, processes them, updates status.

**Dead-letter queue strategy**:

Jobs that fail after max attempts are moved to dead-letter queue for manual review:

- Admin receives notification: "X jobs failed permanently. Review required."
- Admin can view failed jobs, see error messages, and manually retry or cancel

**Backup and restore strategy**:

- **Automated daily backups**: Full database backup at 02:00 CET, retained for 30 days
- **Point-in-time recovery**: Transaction logs retained for 7 days, allowing restore to any point within that window
- **Backup testing**: Monthly automated restore test to verify backup integrity
- **Disaster recovery**: Backups stored in geographically separate region (if primary is Oslo, backup is Stockholm)

### 3.3 Performance

**Indexing strategy**:

Common queries are optimized with database indexes:

- Appointments by date and employee: `INDEX (tenant_id, employee_id, appointment_date)`
- Customers by phone: `INDEX (tenant_id, phone)`
- Customers by email: `INDEX (tenant_id, email)`
- Sales by date: `INDEX (tenant_id, payment_date)`

**Caching layer**:

Read-heavy endpoints use caching to reduce database load:

- Dashboard statistics (today's revenue, upcoming appointments): Cached for 5 minutes
- Employee schedules: Cached for 1 hour
- Service and product catalogs: Cached until modified

Cache invalidation is triggered by relevant mutations (e.g., creating appointment invalidates dashboard stats cache).

**Serverless cold-start mitigation**:

If deployed on Vercel (serverless functions), cold starts can add 1-2 second latency. Mitigations:

- Keep functions warm with periodic health check pings
- Optimize bundle size (tree-shaking, code splitting)
- Use edge functions for latency-sensitive endpoints (booking availability check)

### 3.4 Scalability

**Horizontal scaling architecture**:

BarberTime is designed to scale horizontally:

- **Stateless API servers**: No session state stored in memory, all state in database or Redis
- **Load balancer**: Distributes traffic across multiple API server instances
- **Database connection pooling**: Each API server maintains connection pool, total connections managed to avoid overwhelming database

**Worker processes for queues**:

Background job processing can scale independently:

- Start with single worker process
- As job volume grows, add more worker processes
- Workers coordinate via database locks to avoid processing same job twice

**Database growth strategy**:

As tenant count grows, database size increases. Strategies:

- **Vertical scaling**: Upgrade to larger database instance (more CPU, RAM, storage)
- **Read replicas**: Route read-heavy queries (reports, dashboard) to read replicas, write queries to primary
- **Partitioning**: If single tenant grows very large (e.g., large salon chain), partition their data into separate table partition

## SECTION 4 – Database Schema (Deep)

### Entity Relationship Overview

The BarberTime database consists of 15 core tables organized into logical domains:

**Identity & Access**: `tenants`, `users`, `sessions`

**Customer Management**: `customers`, `customer_notes`

**Service Catalog**: `services`, `service_categories`, `employees`, `employee_schedules`

**Appointments & Bookings**: `appointments`, `appointment_services`, `recurrence_rules`

**Inventory & Sales**: `products`, `product_categories`, `order_items`, `orders`

**Financial**: `payments`, `refunds`, `cash_register_shifts`

**System**: `notifications`, `audit_logs`, `settings`

### Design Decisions and Rationale

**Why row-based isolation instead of schema-per-tenant?**

Row-based isolation (single schema, `tenant_id` column) is simpler to maintain and scales better for thousands of tenants. Schema-per-tenant would require dynamic schema creation, complex migration management, and connection pooling challenges.

**Why soft delete for customers and employees?**

Hard deletion would break referential integrity in historical records (appointments, sales). Soft delete (using `deleted_at` timestamp) preserves data integrity while hiding deleted entities from active use.

**Why separate `orders` and `order_items` tables?**

This allows mixed orders (services + products in one transaction) and maintains proper normalization. Each order item can reference either a service or product, with quantity and pricing captured at transaction time.

**Why store price in `appointment_services` and `order_items`?**

Prices change over time. Storing the price at transaction time ensures historical accuracy—reports show what was actually charged, not current prices.

**Why JSON for `audit_logs.before_value` and `after_value`?**

Audit logs track changes to various entity types with different schemas. JSON provides flexibility without requiring separate audit tables for each entity type.

### Layout Guidelines (Next.js + React + TailwindCSS)

BarberTime uses a modern, clean design with Norwegian sensibilities:

**Color Palette**:
- Primary: Deep blue (#1E3A8A) - trust, professionalism
- Accent: Warm orange (#F97316) - energy, action
- Success: Green (#10B981)
- Warning: Amber (#F59E0B)
- Error: Red (#EF4444)
- Neutral: Gray scale (#F9FAFB to #111827)

**Typography**:
- Headings: Inter (sans-serif), bold, large sizes
- Body: Inter, regular, 16px base size
- UI elements: Inter, medium, 14px

**Spacing**:
- Consistent 8px grid system
- Component padding: 16px (mobile), 24px (desktop)
- Section spacing: 48px (mobile), 96px (desktop)

**Components**:
- Rounded corners: 8px (buttons, cards), 12px (modals)
- Shadows: Subtle, layered (0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1))
- Buttons: Large touch targets (min 44px height), clear hover states
- Forms: Clear labels above inputs, inline validation, helpful error messages

### Accessibility Considerations

**Contrast**: All text meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text)

**Font sizes**: Minimum 14px for UI text, 16px for body content, scalable with browser zoom

**Keyboard usage**:
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Clear focus indicators (blue outline)
- Logical tab order
- Escape key closes modals
- Enter key submits forms

**Screen readers**:
- Semantic HTML (nav, main, section, article)
- ARIA labels for icon-only buttons
- ARIA live regions for dynamic content (notifications, loading states)

**Color independence**: Information is not conveyed by color alone (icons, text labels accompany color coding)

### Consistent Design System

BarberTime uses a **design token system** to ensure consistency:

**Colors**: Defined as CSS variables in `index.css`, referenced throughout components

**Spacing**: Tailwind spacing scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96)

**Typography**: Defined text styles (heading-1, heading-2, body, caption) as Tailwind classes

**Components**: Reusable components in `client/src/components/ui/` (Button, Card, Input, Modal, etc.) built with shadcn/ui

**Icons**: Lucide React icon library for consistency

This design system is documented in `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` for future developers.

   - Sees salon name, address, phone number at top

2. **Select Service**
   - Customer sees list of available services with names, durations, and prices
   - Clicks desired service (e.g., "Herreklipp - 30 min - 350 NOK")

3. **Select Employee (Optional)**

### Employee Soft Delete

**Goal**: Remove employee from active use while preserving historical data.

**Steps**:

1. **Business Rules**
   - Only owner or admin can deactivate employees
   - Cannot deactivate last active owner (must transfer ownership first)
   - Cannot deactivate employee with unpaid commissions (must settle first)

2. **Initiate Deactivation**
   - Admin navigates to Employees page
   - Clicks "Deaktiver" button on employee card
   - System checks for future appointments assigned to this employee

3. **Handle Future Bookings**
   - If employee has future appointments, system shows modal:
     - "Denne ansatte har X fremtidige timer. Hva vil du gjøre?"
     - Option 1: "Overfør til annen ansatt" (dropdown to select employee)
     - Option 2: "Avbestill alle timer"
     - Option 3: "La meg håndtere manuelt" (deactivates employee but leaves appointments)
   - Admin selects option and confirms

4. **Reassigning Future Bookings**
   - If admin selects "Overfør til annen ansatt":
     - System checks availability of target employee for each appointment
     - If target employee is available, reassigns appointment
     - If target employee is not available, adds appointment to "Requires manual handling" list
     - System sends SMS to each affected customer: "Din time hos [Old Employee] er flyttet til [New Employee] på grunn av endringer i vår bemanning. Samme tid: [Date] kl [Time]. Spørsmål? Ring oss på [Phone]."

5. **Canceling Appointments**
   - If admin selects "Avbestill alle timer":
     - System cancels all future appointments with reason "Employee no longer available"
     - System sends SMS to each customer: "Din time hos [Salon] må dessverre avbestilles på grunn av endringer i vår bemanning. Bestill ny time her: [Booking Link]"

6. **Deactivation**
   - System sets `isActive = false` and `deactivatedAt = NOW()`
   - Employee disappears from:
     - Online booking employee selection
     - Appointment creation employee dropdown
     - Active employee lists
   - Employee remains visible in:
     - Historical appointment records (with "(inaktiv)" suffix)
     - Sales reports for past periods
     - Audit logs

7. **Logging the Change**
   - System creates audit log entry:
     - Action: `employee_deactivated`
     - Entity: `employee`
     - Entity ID: employee ID
     - Before value: `{ isActive: true }`
     - After value: `{ isActive: false, deactivatedAt: '2025-01-15T10:30:00Z' }`
     - User: admin who performed action
     - Timestamp: now

**Success Criteria**: Employee is removed from active use, future bookings are handled appropriately, historical data remains intact.

### Day Closing (Kasseoppgjør)

**Goal**: Reconcile cash register at end of business day, generate close-of-day report.

**Steps**:

1. **Aggregate Sales**
   - At end of day, staff navigates to Dashboard
   - Clicks "Avslutt dag" button
   - System aggregates all sales for current date:
     - Total revenue
     - Breakdown by payment method (cash, card, Vipps)
     - Number of transactions
     - List of all transactions (appointment-based and direct sales)

2. **Compare with Payments**
   - System calculates expected cash: opening balance + cash payments - cash refunds
   - System displays expected amounts:
     - Expected cash: X NOK
     - Expected card: Y NOK (verified via Stripe/terminal)
     - Expected Vipps: Z NOK (verified via Vipps)

3. **Physical Count**
   - Staff counts physical cash in register
   - Enters actual cash amount in form
   - System compares expected vs actual

4. **Handle Discrepancy**
   - If amounts match: "Kassen stemmer! Ingen avvik." (green checkmark)
   - If discrepancy exists: "Avvik: [Difference] NOK. Forventet [Expected], faktisk [Actual]" (yellow warning)
   - Staff enters explanation in text field (required if discrepancy > 50 NOK)

5. **Generate Report**
   - System generates close-of-day report (PDF):
     - Salon name and date
     - Total sales: X NOK
     - Payment method breakdown
     - Number of transactions
     - Cash discrepancy (if any) with explanation
     - Staff member who closed: [Name]
     - Timestamp: [Date Time]
   - Report is saved to database and emailed to owner

6. **Lock the Day**
   - System creates `cash_register_shifts` record with status `closed`
   - Day is locked—past transactions cannot be edited (prevents fraud)
   - Staff sees confirmation: "Dagen er avsluttet. Rapporten er sendt til [Owner Email]."

**Success Criteria**: Cash register is reconciled, discrepancies are documented, day is locked to prevent tampering.

### CSV Export

**Goal**: Generate accounting-friendly CSV export for external use.

**Steps**:

1. **Filter Selection**
   - User navigates to Reports page
   - Clicks "Eksporter" button
   - Modal opens with export options:
     - Report type: Sales, Appointments, Customers, Inventory
     - Date range: Start date, end date (max 1 year)
     - Employee filter: All employees, or select specific employee
     - Format: CSV (default), Excel (future)

2. **Generation**
   - User clicks "Generer eksport"
   - System queues background job (to avoid blocking UI for large exports)
   - User sees: "Eksporten genereres. Du får en e-post når den er klar."

3. **Processing**
   - Background worker picks up job
   - Queries database based on filters
   - Generates CSV with columns appropriate for report type

   **Sales CSV columns**:
   - Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Time (HH:MM)
   - Customer name
   - Employee name
   - Service/Product name
   - Quantity
   - Unit price (excl. VAT)
   - VAT rate (%)
   - VAT amount
   - Total (incl. VAT)
   - Payment method
   - Account code (Norwegian standard)

4. **Encoding**
   - CSV is encoded as UTF-8 with BOM (Byte Order Mark)
   - This ensures Excel on Windows correctly displays Norwegian characters (æ, ø, å)

5. **Upload and Notify**
   - CSV file is uploaded to S3 with 24-hour expiration
   - System generates pre-signed download URL
   - System sends email to user: "Din eksport er klar. Last ned her: [Link] (lenken utløper om 24 timer)"

6. **Download**
   - User clicks link in email
   - CSV file downloads
   - User opens in Excel or imports to accounting software (Tripletex, PowerOffice, etc.)

**Success Criteria**: Export completes within 5 minutes for typical data volumes, file opens correctly in Excel with Norwegian characters intact.

## Conclusion

This specification provides a complete blueprint for building BarberTime, a production-grade SaaS platform tailored for Norwegian salons. Every section is designed with real-world implementation in mind, balancing technical depth with practical business considerations.

The focus on **simplicity** (enkelt og ryddig UX), **Norwegian-first design** (Vipps, VAT, SAF-T), and **vertical integration** (all features in one system) positions BarberTime to solve the specific pain points of Norwegian salon owners better than generic international competitors.

The architecture is **scalable** (multi-tenant, horizontal scaling), **secure** (GDPR-compliant, encrypted), and **reliable** (transactions, backups, monitoring), ensuring that BarberTime can grow from a startup serving 50 salons to a market leader serving thousands.

The **roadmap** provides a clear path from MVP to advanced features, allowing the team to ship value quickly while building toward a comprehensive platform that salon owners will rely on daily.

This is not a generic SaaS template—it is a deeply considered, Norwegian-market-specific solution ready to be built by a senior engineering team.
