## Summary of Issues Found

### Critical Issues (Blocking)
*None*

### High Priority Issues

#### 1. TypeScript Errors in FikenSettings.tsx
**Location:** `client/src/pages/FikenSettings.tsx` lines 35-45  
**Issue:** TypeScript cannot infer types correctly for `trpc.fiken.*` procedures  
**Error:** `Property 'useQuery/useMutation' does not exist on type...`  
**Root Cause:** `fiken` router is created via `createFikenRouter()` function instead of being defined inline like other routers (e.g., `unimicro`, `export`)  
**Impact:** TypeScript compilation errors (9 errors), but code works correctly at runtime  
**Recommended Fix:** Refactor `fiken` router to be defined inline in `server/routers.ts` like `unimicro` router, OR add proper type annotations to `createFikenRouter` function  
**Workaround:** Can be ignored as it doesn't affect runtime functionality  
**Priority:** High (affects developer experience and CI/CD)

### Medium Priority Issues
*None found*

### Low Priority Issues

#### 1. Console Warning: require() in ES module
**Location:** Server console  
**Message:** `ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope`  
**Impact:** Warning only, doesn't affect functionality  
**Priority:** Low

## Detailed Analysis

### Code Quality Assessment

#### ✅ Strengths
1. **Clean Architecture:** Well-organized code structure with clear separation of concerns
2. **Type Safety:** Extensive use of TypeScript and Zod for runtime validation
3. **Modern Stack:** React 19, tRPC 11, Tailwind 4, Drizzle ORM
4. **Component Reusability:** Good use of shadcn/ui components
5. **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints
6. **Security:** Protected procedures, tenant isolation, email verification
7. **User Experience:** Smooth navigation, clear CTAs, professional design

#### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement
1. **TypeScript Configuration:** Router type inference needs fixing for Fiken integration
2. **Code Consistency:** Mixed patterns for router creation (inline vs factory function)
3. **Documentation:** Some complex routers lack inline documentation
