# Unimicro Integration Research

## Overview
Unimicro is a popular Norwegian ERP/accounting system with a comprehensive REST API. This document outlines the integration possibilities for BarberTime.

## Authentication
- **Method**: OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- **Flow Options**:
  1. **Server Application** (Recommended for BarberTime)
     - Certificate-based authentication
     - Server acts on behalf of companies without human interaction
     - Can request necessary permissions when activated on a company
     - Best for automated sync operations
  
  2. **Traditional Web Apps**
     - Authorization Code Flow with client secret
     - Suitable for ASP.NET Core MVC, Next.js
  
  3. **SPA/Mobile Apps**
     - Authorization Code Flow with PKCE
     - For public clients that cannot store secrets

## API Documentation
- **Base URL**: https://developer.unimicro.no/
- **Architecture**: REST API with JSON request/response
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI format

## Key API Endpoints for BarberTime Integration

### 1. CustomerInvoice (Kundefaktura)
**Endpoint**: `/CustomerInvoice`

**Key Fields**:
- `CustomerID` (integer) - Customer reference

  - 42001 = Draft (Utkast)
  - 42002 = Invoiced (Fakturert)
  - 42003 = PartlyPaid (Delvis betalt)
  - 42004 = Paid (Betalt)
  - 42005 = Sold (Solgt)
  - 42006 = Credited (Kreditert)
  - 42007 = PartlyCredited (Delvis kreditert)
- `TaxExclusiveAmount` (decimal) - Amount excluding VAT

- Ensure proper accounting classification

### 4. Payment (Betaling)
**Endpoint**: `/Payment` or `/InvoicePayment`

**Use Case**:

## Integration Architecture for BarberTime

### Recommended Approach: Server-to-Server Integration

```
BarberTime Backend (Node.js/Express)
    ↓
OAuth 2.0 Certificate Authentication
    ↓
Unimicro API (REST)
    ↓
Accounting System
```

### Data Flow

1. **Daily Sales Sync** (Automated)
   - Every night at 23:00, sync completed orders from BarberTime to Unimicro
   - Create CustomerInvoice records for each POS sale
   - Include line items (services + products)
   - Mark as "Invoiced" (StatusCode: 42002)

2. **Customer Sync** (Bi-directional)
   - When new customer created in BarberTime → create in Unimicro
   - When customer updated in Unimicro → update in BarberTime (webhook)
   - Match by phone number or email

3. **Payment Recording**
   - When payment recorded in BarberTime POS → record in Unimicro
   - Link payment to invoice
   - Update invoice status to "Paid" when fully paid

4. **Accounting Entries**
   - Map BarberTime services to Unimicro accounts
   - Automatically create journal entries for:
     - Revenue (services + products)
     - VAT (25% Norwegian standard rate)
     - Payment methods (cash, card, Stripe, Vipps)
     - Refunds and cancellations

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Setup & Authentication
1. Register BarberTime as application in Unimicro Developer Portal
2. Create server authentication client with certificate
3. Implement OAuth 2.0 flow in backend
4. Store access tokens securely in database
5. Add Unimicro credentials to salonSettings table

### Phase 2: Customer Sync
1. Create mapping between BarberTime customers and Unimicro customers
2. Implement customer creation endpoint
3. Implement customer update endpoint
4. Add "Sync to Unimicro" toggle in Settings

### Phase 3: Invoice Creation
1. Create invoice generation logic
2. Map BarberTime orders to CustomerInvoice format
3. Include line items (services + products)
4. Handle VAT calculations (25%)
5. Add invoice reference to orders table

### Phase 4: Payment Sync
1. Record payments in Unimicro when POS payment completed
2. Update invoice status based on payment
3. Handle partial payments
4. Sync refunds as credit notes

### Phase 5: Reporting & Monitoring
1. Create Unimicro sync status page in admin dashboard
2. Show last sync time, success/failure count
3. Display sync errors with retry button
4. Add manual sync trigger button

## Database Schema Changes

### New Table: `unimicroSettings`
```sql
CREATE TABLE unimicroSettings (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  tenantId INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES tenants(id),
  enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  clientId TEXT,
  certificatePath TEXT,
  accessToken TEXT,
  refreshToken TEXT,
  tokenExpiresAt TIMESTAMP,
  companyId INTEGER,
  lastSyncAt TIMESTAMP,
  syncErrors TEXT,
  createdAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updatedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### New Table: `unimicroInvoiceMapping`
```sql
CREATE TABLE unimicroInvoiceMapping (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  tenantId INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES tenants(id),
  orderId INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES orders(id),
  unimicroInvoiceId INTEGER NOT NULL,
  unimicroInvoiceNumber TEXT NOT NULL,
  syncedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  status TEXT, -- 'synced', 'failed', 'paid'
  errorMessage TEXT
);
```

### New Table: `unimicroAccountMapping`
```sql
CREATE TABLE unimicroAccountMapping (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  tenantId INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES tenants(id),
  entityType TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'service', 'product', 'payment_method'
  entityId INTEGER NOT NULL,
  unimicroAccountId INTEGER NOT NULL,
  unimicroAccountNumber TEXT NOT NULL,
  createdAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Benefits for Salon Owners

1. **Eliminates Double Entry**
   - Sales automatically flow from BarberTime to accounting
   - No manual invoice creation needed
   - Reduces errors and saves time

2. **Real-Time Financial Overview**
   - Always up-to-date accounting records
   - Accurate VAT calculations
   - Proper revenue recognition

3. **Compliance**
   - Meets Norwegian accounting requirements
   - Proper audit trail
   - VAT reporting ready

4. **Professional Invoicing**

## Pricing Considerations

- Unimicro API access is included with Unimicro subscription
- No additional API fees (typically)
- Salon must have active Unimicro account
- BarberTime can offer this as premium feature (e.g., "Bedrift" plan)

## Competitive Advantage

- Most salon software in Norway lacks accounting integration
- Unimicro is widely used by Norwegian SMBs
- This feature would differentiate BarberTime significantly
- Targets professional salons with accountants

## Next Steps

1. Contact Unimicro to register as integration partner
2. Get access to developer sandbox environment
3. Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication
4. Build MVP with basic invoice sync
5. Test with pilot salon
6. Expand to full feature set

- Authentication Guide: https://developer.unimicro.no/guide/authentication/overview
- API Documentation: https://developer.unimicro.no/docs
- Community: https://developer.unimicro.no/ (Community link)

## Technical Notes

- API uses standard REST conventions
- JSON request/response format
- OAuth 2.0 for authentication
- Supports webhooks for real-time updates
- Custom fields available for extended data
- Ad-hoc queries for complex filtering
- Rate limiting likely in place (check documentation)

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**:
- Well-documented API
- Standard OAuth 2.0
- REST architecture (familiar)
- JSON format (easy to work with)

**Medium Risk**:
- Certificate-based auth (need to implement properly)
- Token refresh logic required
- Error handling for sync failures
- Data mapping complexity

**Mitigation**:
- Start with read-only operations (test connection)
- Implement comprehensive error logging
- Add manual retry mechanisms
- Provide clear error messages to users
- Test thoroughly in sandbox before production

## Estimated Development Time

- Phase 1 (Setup & Auth): 2-3 days
- Phase 2 (Customer Sync): 2-3 days
- Phase 3 (Invoice Creation): 3-4 days
- Phase 4 (Payment Sync): 2-3 days
- Phase 5 (Reporting): 2 days
- Testing & Bug Fixes: 3-4 days

**Total**: ~15-20 days of development

## Conclusion

Unimicro integration is highly feasible and would provide significant value to BarberTime users. The API is well-documented, uses standard technologies, and covers all necessary accounting operations. This feature would position BarberTime as a complete business solution for Norwegian salons, not just a booking system.
